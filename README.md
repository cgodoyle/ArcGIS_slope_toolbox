## Disclaimer

**This is not an official NVE product**.<br />
This toolbox is under development and may contain errors. <br />
It is assumed that the user has sufficient understanding of the procedure for assessing terrain criteria in accordance with NVE 1/2019. 
Pay particular attention to:

- Take into account all possible source points where landslides can be initiated. An area can have runouts in several directions!
- Depth to source points must be assessed in each case. Each line can have different depths (ewd).
- The toolbox is intended as an aid for geotechnical assessment - not as a replacement. The user must always use his own judgment.
